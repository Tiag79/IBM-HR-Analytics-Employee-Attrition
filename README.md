# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Analysis  

## Overview  
This project explores the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition** dataset to analyze employee turnover and identify the key factors influencing attrition. By leveraging data analytics techniques, this study aims to provide actionable insights for organizations to enhance employee retention strategies.  

## Project Goals  
- Analyze employee attrition trends within the dataset.  
- Identify key factors contributing to attrition.  
- Provide recommendations based on data-driven insights.  
## Dataset  
The dataset contains employee-related attributes, including demographic details, job roles, satisfaction levels, and more. The data was sourced from IBM's HR analytics repository.  

### Key Features in the Dataset:  
- Age  
- Job Role  
- Department  
- Monthly Income  
- Job Satisfaction  
- Years at Company  
- Work-Life Balance  

## Steps in the Analysis  
1. ** Understand the Business Problem
 -Problem:  
 Companies lose money when employees leave. The goal is to predict which employees are likely to leave based on various factors (e.g., salary, job satisfaction, work-life balance).

-Business Impact:

 HR teams can take action to retain valuable employees.
 Helps companies reduce hiring and training costs.
 Improves employee satisfaction by addressing concerns early.
 
-Success Metrics (KPIs):

Model accuracy (e.g., 85%+ accuracy in predictions).
Retention improvement (e.g., reducing employee turnover by 10%).

2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:
  
 - Initial understanding of the dataset's structure.  
 - Handling missing values,duplicate values, inconsistencies and outliers.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
 - Visualizing trends and correlations.  
 - Identifying patterns in employee attrition.

4.**Train a Machine Learning Model
 -Convert categorical variables into numbers.
 -Split data into training and testing sets.
 -Train a classification model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
 -Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.
  
5. **Insights and Recommendations**:  
 - Pinpointing critical factors contributing to attrition.  
 - Proposing actionable steps for employee retention.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Python**: Core programming language for the analysis.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for data exploration and visualization.  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Business Insights & Recommendations

Based on our analysis of the IBM HR Analytics data, key findings include:
- **High Overtime Impact:** Employees working overtime are highly likely to leave.
- **Tenure-Related Attrition:** Longer tenure is surprisingly correlated with attrition, suggesting potential engagement issues.
- **Role-Specific Trends:** Certain roles (e.g., Laboratory Technician, Sales Representative) exhibit higher attrition rates.
- **Frequent Business Travel:** Increased travel frequency is linked to higher attrition.
  

## Recommendations
  
- (List practical suggestions or strategies derived from your ana lysis.)  Recommendations by Sandrine Mujinga:
### Recommendations:
- **Reduce Overtime:** Implement workload management and flexible scheduling.
- **Career Development:** Provide clear career paths(including promotion plan) and mentorship & leadership trainings opportunities.
- **Employee Engagement:** Enhance work culture through regular feedback and support programs(offer personalized retention plans based on job role,experience and manager relationships).
- **Review Travel Policies:** Consider adjustments to reduce travel stress.Offer remote work flexibility where possible.(I mprove Work-Life Balance)
